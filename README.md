## Description
React Todo is a todo app which allows for creation, editing and deleting of the todos. The app is connected to a real API and so, the todos will remain there until you modify or delete them!

## Stack
This app was created using the lovely **React, ES6, Axios, Bootstrap, Webpack, CRA and Netlify** to deploy. Additionally, you can check it out and use it for yourself right now: https://rtd.netlify.com
